## Short Description

This is desktop clone of the famous application called olx where you can sell used items of all category and new items as well.This repo is no commit history version of the app so you won't be able to see the commit history of this repo ('i have made my main remote repo private').This app has all the core fuctionality of the olx, and i tried to replicate the desktop design of the web app adding all the functionality like that  of olx (this is not a responsive web app). fun fact is that this app was created a long time ago with minimum functionality due to some other factors , then now i updated this app with all the core functionality.

## What are the core functionalities

### Authentication


Like all other app this app also have a login and signup component where you can signup for a new account or just login with email and password or with google login.this app also have an forgotten password route for resetting your password.

### Edit and View profile


Its very important to show user details and also allow them to edit their details.Edit profile component can edit basic details of the user like username, email,phone and add description.View profile shows the user details and also shows the published ads of the user, giving the user the ability to edit and delete his post.


### Creating, Editing and Deleting Ads


Another important functionality of the is to create or post new ads. here user can post new ads with a wide range of categories and fields related to each category, can upload mutiple images and include details of the item. as i said in the earlier heading, user can go to view profile to see his/her published ads and also can edit and delete the post.In edit ad component user can  edit basic details of the post.

### Search and Filter


Very Important and core feature of every app is to search and filter data.
this app has a seprate filter page which users can filter ads based on categories,location posted and with budget range.Other than filter page this app has a dedicated fitlering in home page which filters ads according to categories and location. The dedicated search bar and location search bar has search auto complete, the search auto complete has a bunch of cool auto completions where user can directly go to post,and also can search for various categories, types and more.
